# PathFinder_Master
The PathFinder_Master repository contains an implementation of the Pathfinder algorithm, a widely-used method in graph theory and pathfinding. This algorithm is designed to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph (using DFS/BFS), which is essential in various applications such as route planning and game development.
